                <h2>Facts about laptop.</h2>
                <p>
                    Here are some facts about laptops: <br>
                    Design <br>
                    Laptops are designed to be portable and have a clamshell design, with the keyboard on the bottom lid and the screen on the top lid. <br>
                    History <br>
                    The first laptop to go on sale was the Osborne 1 in 1981. Toshiba's T1100 was the first mass-market laptop, released in 1985. <br>
                    Components <br>
                    Laptops are typically not designed for users to replace or upgrade components, except for those that can be detached. <br>
                    Storage and memory <br>
                    Laptops often have more storage and memory options than notebooks, with larger hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs) and higher RAM capacities. <br>
                    Recycling <br>
                    Laptops can be recycled to recover valuable metals like copper, silver, gold, and palladium. Many manufacturers and retailers accept electronic recycling. <br>
                    Ultrabooks <br>
                    Ultrabooks are a longer-lasting type of laptop that are lightweight and thin, but still have good battery life, performance, and features. <br>
                    Docking stations <br>
                    A docking station is a hardware frame that allows a laptop to be connected to peripheral devices like a monitor, keyboard, and printer, turning it into a desktop computer.

                    A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.[1][2] Most of the computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers. <br>
                

                    Laptops can run on both AC power and rechargable battery packs and can be folded shut for convenient storage and transportation, making them suitable for mobile use.[3] Laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on business trips), in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.

                    The word laptop, modeled after the term desktop (as in desktop computer), refers to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on the user's lap; while the word notebook refers to most laptops sharing a form factor with paper notebooks. As of 2024, in American English, the terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably;[4] in other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred.[5] The term notebook originally referred to a type of portable computer that was smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time, but has since come to mean the same thing and no longer refers to any specific size.

                    Laptops combine many of the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer into a single unit, including a display screen (usually 11–17 in or 280–430 mm in diagonal size), small speakers, a keyboard, and a pointing device (namely compact ones such as touchpads or pointing sticks). Most modern laptops include a built-in webcam and microphone, and many also have touchscreens. Hardware specifications may vary significantly between different types, models, and price points.

                    Design elements, form factors, and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on the intended use. Examples of specialized models of laptops include 2-in-1 laptops, with keyboards that either be detached or pivoted out of view from the display (often marketed having a "laptop mode"); rugged laptops, for use in construction or military applications; and low-production-cost laptops such as those from the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) organization, which incorporate features like solar charging and semi-flexible components not found on most laptop computers. Portable computers, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small niche market, mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, for accountants, or traveling sales representatives. As portable computers evolved into modern laptops, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.[6]
